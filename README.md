# Haar Cascade Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Haar Cascade algorithm, a machine learning object detection algorithm used in computer vision applications.

## Description:
The Haar Cascade algorithm, created by Viola and Jones, is a feature-based approach used for object detection. It works by training a cascade function to classify whether a subsection of an image contains a particular object of interest or not. This algorithm is known for its efficiency in detecting objects in images and videos.

## Implementation Details:
In this implementation, we utilized the Viola-Jones algorithm, which significantly contributed to the advancements in object detection. The algorithm involves training a cascade of classifiers based on Haar-like features to efficiently detect objects with high accuracy.

## Usage:
- Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
- Run the main script, providing the path to the input image file.
- The script will detect objects in the provided image and display the results.

Feel free to explore and modify the algorithm to suit your specific object detection needs.
